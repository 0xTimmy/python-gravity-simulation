<h1>Python Gravity Simulation</h1>

<br>

This is a python simulation of gravity on different planets.

<h3>Guiding Question: How will the different amounts of gravity affect the output (a work of art) of the experiment?</h3>

<h3>I looked at a variety of projects that aimed to simulate gravity, and there seem to be a few methods. I can drop the ball off a cliff, which I program in Python, and record how it reacts bouncing around. I can draw a box and then bounce the ball around the box. (Ended up choosing).</h3>

When I looked at the Python documentation, I found out that there were many built-in functions that would help me program my Turtle. Those built-in functions include:
<br>
• penup() <br>
• hideturtle() <br>
• goto() <br>
• color() <br>

I was thinking about different ways to run this simulation, and I had two options. I could run the simulation at every frame, moving the turtle and all, or I could create a function that moves the turtle and executes it every time the ball hits the side of the box. I ended up deciding on the latter for the sake of simplicity.
